# Next-Gen-Car-Price-Forecaster
This repository showcases DeepDrive Analytics, a sophisticated machine learning project dedicated to predicting car prices with unparalleled accuracy. Developed by Hardik Sharma, this solution harnesses the power of TensorFlow and Keras to intelligently analyze diverse vehicle attributes and forecast their market value.

Key Features:

Advanced Data Engineering: Implemented robust data preprocessing, including meticulous One-Hot Encoding, to transform raw, heterogeneous automotive datasets into a structured format ready for deep learning.
Optimized Neural Network Architecture: Designed and built a custom Sequential model with dense layers and ReLU activations, specifically tuned for high-performance regression tasks.
Comprehensive Performance Metrics: Beyond standard error, the model's predictive precision is quantified using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for practical interpretability (average dollar prediction error) and a custom R-squared metric, offering a clear measure of explained variance.
Reproducible & Scalable Design: Followed best practices for data splitting and model training, ensuring the solution is reliable, verifiable, and extensible for future enhancements.
Insightful Training Visualization: Integrated custom Keras callbacks to provide real-time, epoch-by-epoch performance monitoring, illuminating the model's learning journey and convergence.
Explore the code to dive into a state-of-the-art approach to solving real-world regression challenges in the automotive sector.
